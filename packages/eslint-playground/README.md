# eslint-playground

A sample project that uses the eslint-config-widen to ensure things are working.
Included is a file to correspond with each eslint plugin type which will throw
lint errors.

### To test updates:

1. Run `yarn ts` in the base package any time you change the code in the
   eslint-config-widen to regen the output.
2. In the eslint-playground package run `yarn lint`

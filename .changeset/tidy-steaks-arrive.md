Update to eslint 9, apps will need to be on eslint 9+ alongside this update.
They will also need to convert their .eslintrc and .eslintignore into the new
format of eslint.config.mjs. Here is a migration guide that goes over the basics
https://eslint.org/docs/latest/use/configure/migration-guide. For general usage
and a sample eslint.config.mjs see the updated readme in this repo.
